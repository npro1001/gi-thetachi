# gi-thetachi
This is an individual project built with the FReMP stack that collects Venmo data for the G.I. Theta Chi Philanthropy. 

The data is sorted based on donors' organizations and stored in a MongoDB database and Google Sheet. 

Additionally, a website is available to display a running total of funds raised to the public. 

You can visit the website [HERE](https://www.githetachi.us) to view the fundraising progress.
