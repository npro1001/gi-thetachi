# gi-thetachi
This project build with the FReMP stack collects Venmo data for the G.I. Theta Chi Philanthropy.

After collection, the script sorts the data based on donors' organization and populates a Google Sheet and MongoDB database.

It also includes a website to display a running fundraising total to the public.

You can visit the site [HERE](https://www.githetachi.us)
